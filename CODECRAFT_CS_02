Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt anD decrypt images.

CODE:- pip install pillow(LIBRARY)


from PIL import Image

def encrypt_image(image_path, key, output_path):
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    encrypted_img = Image.new(img.mode, img.size)
    pixels = img.load()
    encrypted_pixels = encrypted_img.load()

    for i in range(img.size[0]):
        for j in range(img.size[1]):
            r, g, b = pixels[i, j]
            # Simple XOR encryption
            encrypted_pixels[i, j] = (r ^ key, g ^ key, b ^ key)

    encrypted_img.save(output_path)
    print(f"Image encrypted and saved as {output_path}")

def decrypt_image(image_path, key, output_path):
    # XOR decryption is same as encryption
    encrypt_image(image_path, key, output_path)

# Example usage
key = 123  # Any number between 0-255
encrypt_image("original_image.jpg", key, "encrypted_image.png")
decrypt_image("encrypted_image.png", key, "decrypted_image.png")
